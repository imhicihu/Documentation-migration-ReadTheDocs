# RATIONALE #

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
    - A way to automatize our produced inner tutorials and documentation alongside the time. Up to now is a way of second branch (_a.k.a_ solution)  to get automated updates. _One caveat_: this repo must fix the `proxy server barrier` that we actually face.
    - [ReadtheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) is a free and [open source](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open-source-philosophy.html) hosting solution for online documentation.
